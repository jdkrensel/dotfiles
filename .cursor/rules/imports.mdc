description: This rule enforces that all import statements are placed at the top of the file and ordered correctly according to PEP 8 guidelines. Imports should never appear inside function or method bodies, as this can lead to hidden dependencies and unexpected behavior.
globs: *.py

According to PEP 8, imports should be grouped in the following order, with a blank line separating each group:

Standard library imports: (e.g., import os, import sys)

Related third-party imports: (e.g., import requests, import pandas)

Local application/library specific imports: (e.g., from my_project import my_module)

All imports should be placed at the top of the module, just after any module-level comments and docstrings, and before any module globals or constants are defined.

Example of correct ordering:

Python

# Standard library imports
import os
import sys

# Third-party imports
import requests

# Local application imports
from my_app.utils import helper_function
from my_app.models import User
This practice ensures that a module's dependencies are clearly visible, avoids circular import issues, and improves code readability and maintainability.
